# MathologerCircles

A quick program that can display points moving in the patterns described in this Mathologer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEN0o9ZGmOM&t=995s

You can toggle the various parts of the shape and you can also adjust how far out the points are placed on the inner circle (giving a more pointy star).

The app can be seen here: https://alex6480.github.io/MathologerCircles/
